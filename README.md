This is a repository for the warm up project at UVM's CS 205 Software Engineering course with Prof. Hibbeler

To run our program, IMDB_Query_Engine.py, you must install the Anaconda3 library and run with the Anaconda3 python interpreter. 
Instructions on how to install Anaconda3 package can be found in the Installing_Python_Pandas_and_Sqlite_via_Anaconda3.txt file.

To run:
	python IMDB_Query_Engine.py

If you're not familiar with programming in Python, I'd highly recommend checking out the Hello_World_Test.py file. It's got some more stuff than just a print statement with "hello world" - that would be lame. Read through, and check out some cool, basic pythonian language semantics.

Instructions for installing git are available for Mac OS

Universal instructions for how to use git are also available

The data sets are in Comma Separated Value (.CSV) format, a picture of the overall data schema is available as well.

Instructions on how to load the CSVs into a Sqlite DB are available, although it's already been done.

If you're unfamiliar with the Sqlite and/or Pandas python library, I'd highly recommend checking out both the Sqlite_Example.py and Pandas_Example.py files!

Query syntax is described in the file Query_Syntax.txt
