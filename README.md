This is a repository for the warm up project at UVM's CS 205 Software Engineering course with Prof. Hibbeler

If you're not familiar with programming in Python, I'd highly recommend checking out the Hello_World_Test.py file. It's got some more stuff than just a print statement with "hello world" - that would be lame. Read through, and check out some cool, basic pythonian language semantics.

Instructions for installing git are available for Mac OS

Universal instructions for how to use git are also available

The data sets are in Comma Separated Value (.CSV) format, a picture of the overall data schema is available as well.

Instructions on how to load the CSVs into a Sqlite DB are available, although it's already been done.

If you're unfamiliar with the Sqlite and/or Pandas python library, I'd highly recommend checking out both the Sqlite_Example.py and Pandas_Example.py files!

Query syntax is described in the file Query_Syntax.txt
