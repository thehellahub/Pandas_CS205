Query semantics:

title title "Harry Potter" year "2008"
                                  ^ Value we're going to look for, against the column we're going to query on
                            ^ Column were going to query on
                ^ Value we're going to look for, against the column we're going to query on
       ^ Column were going to query on
^ Desired data field we want to return       


This would return:
  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince  		   


Let's say we want to see more than one data field... Our query might look like:

title,date title "Harry Potter" year 2008

  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince  				2008   

	
title,date,genre title "Harry Potter"
