Installing Python, Pandas & Sqlite3 via Anaconda3

Author: Nick Hella

The easiest way to install Pandas is to install it as part of the Anaconda distribution, a cross platform distribution for data analysis and scientific computing. If you don’t have Python3.6 already installed on your computer, this package will solve that issue.

Installation instructions for Anaconda:

Windows: 	https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/windows/

MacOS: 	https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/mac-os/

Linux: 		https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/linux/

Following the installation, you should see an app called Anaconda-Navigator.

If you switch to the “Environments” pane on the left, you should be able to find both python and pandas in the package list.


To verify that you have successfully installed Anaconda, open a new terminal and enter the following command:

	conda list

From this command, you should see the same list of packages that you previously saw when you opened the Anaconda-Navigator app in the Environments pane.
