pandas is a powerful, open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, 
easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

This file will demonstrate some of the simple queries one can use with our data sets.


More documentation on pandas is available on their website:

	https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/


More simple pandas examples can also be found here:

To run this file, (1.) open a terminal	(2.) move into the directory of this file 	(3.) run the command below

	python Pandas_Example.py

Note, you made need to specify python3 instead of python if you have python2.x by default
