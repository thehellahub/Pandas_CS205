Let’s try running the command “git” from your terminal..


If you get an error like: 

dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libswiftCore.dylib
Referenced from: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/xcodebuild
Reason: image not found
git: error: unable to locate xcodebuild, please make sure the path to the Xcode folder is set correctly!
git: error: You can set the path to the Xcode folder using /usr/bin/xcode-select -switch


Enter the following:

		sudo xcode-select --switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/


If you never got that error, you’re a rockstar. That took me way too long to figure out how to fix.. Anyways!


Now you should be able to run “git” from the command line...

	

Now let’s create a project directory on your local machine. Enter the following command into your terminal:
		
		mkdir ~/Documents/CS_205/PANDAS_CS205
	

Let’s now initialize this this directory in git. Enter the following command:
		cd ~/Documents/CS_205/PANDAS_CS205 && git init


Now if you type “git status”, you should see the following output:
		
		On branch master

		No commits yet
